Use http://www.modbus.org/[Modbus] with your Arduino. 

Using TCP or RS485 shields, like the MKR 485 Shield. This library depends on the ArduinoRS485 library.

This library is based on https://github.com/stephane/libmodbus[libmodbus], modifications were made to the lower level RS485 and TCP layers to use Arduino Serial/RS485 and Client API's. Then an Arduino friendly API was added on top.
