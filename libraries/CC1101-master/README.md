General description of RF packet
================================

```
-> pkt_len [1byte] | rx_addr [1byte] | tx_addr [1byte] | payload data [1..60bytes]
```

pkt_len = count of bytes which shall transfered over air (rx_addr + tx_addr + payload data)<br />
rx_addr = address of device, which shall receive the message (0x00 = broadcast to all devices)<br />
tx_addr = transmitter or my address. the receiver should know who has sent a message.<br />
payload = 1 to 60 bytes payload data.<br />

TX Bytes example:<br />
-> 0x06 0x03 0x01 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03<br />

Basic configuration
===================

use **uint8_t CC1100::begin(volatile uint8_t &My_addr)** always as first configuration step. For Arduino devices, this function returns the device address, which was already stored in the Arduino EEPROM.

Device address
--------------
you should set a unique device address for the transmitter and a unique device address for the receiver. 
This can be done with **void CC1100::set_myaddr(uint8_t addr)**.

i.E. -> TX = 0x01 ; RX = 0x03


Modulation modes
----------------
the following modulation modes can be set by **void CC1100::set_mode(uint8_t mode)**. Transmitter and receiver must have the same Mode setting.

```
1 = GFSK_1_2_kb
2 = GFSK_38_4_kb
3 = GFSK_100_kb
4 = MSK_250_kb
5 = MSK_500_kb
6 = OOK_4_8_kb
```

ISM frequency band
------------------
you can set a frequency operation band by **void CC1100::set_ISM(uint8_t ism_freq)** to make it compatible with your hardware.

```
1 = 315
2 = 433
3 = 868
4 = 915
```

Arduino specific
================

CC1101 RF settings must be stored in the Arduino EEPROM to have maximum flexibility with different mode settings and reduced memory usage.
Follow the following steps, how to store the compiled EEPROM file (*.eep) to your Arduino EEPROM. From my experience, you have to repeat this step only, if you have changed the Arduino Version, because the gcc compiler defines the location of the eeprom settings.

- compile the tx_demo or rx_demo example sketch
- remember the path of your compiled output data (Arduino *.hex file and *.eep file)
- use the python eeprom_create.py to generate the eeprom array for the eeprom_write.ino
  This is needed because the compiler can choose the EEPROM position by its own.
- usage: ``` ./eeprom_create.py <input *.eep file> ```
- you get an output file with like *.array
- open that file and copy the array content into the eeprom_write.ino sketch at the correct position
- compile the eeprom_write.ino sketch
- upload into to your connected arduino hardware
- open the Arduino Serial console, set the baudrate to 38400 and restart your arduino hardware
- type the character ```w``` to the input field and press the sent button
- wait till eeprom is written
- sent ```r``` to verify that eeprom is written.
- if your EEPROM data is written correct, you can compile and upload the RX_Demo or TX_Demo sketch to that hardware


Raspberry Pi
============

How to compile Raspi Demo files
-------------------------------

be sure first, that you have already wiringPi installed on your Raspberry Pi hardware. 

copy RX_Demo.cpp, TX_Demo.cpp, cc1100_raspi.cpp, cc1100_raspi.h in the same directory and compile: <br />

RX_Demo.cpp<br />
```
sudo g++ -lwiringPi RX_Demo.cpp cc1100_raspi.cpp -o RX_Demo
sudo chmod 755 RX_Demo
```

TX_Demo.cpp<br />
```
sudo g++ -lwiringPi TX_Demo.cpp cc1100_raspi.cpp -o TX_Demo
sudo chmod 755 TX_Demo
```
