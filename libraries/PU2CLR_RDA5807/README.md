# RDA5807 Arduino Library

It is a cross-platform Arduini Library for RDA5807. You can use it with oficial Arduino boards, ATtiny, STM32 , ESP32 and more. It works with I2C protocol and can provide you an easier interface to control the RDA5807 device. This library was built based on "RDA5807M - SINGLE-CHIP BROADCAST FM RADIO TUNER - Rev.1.1–Aug.2015"

This library can be freely distributed using the MIT Free Software model.

## Preface 

The RDA5807 is a FM DSP integrated circuit receiver (50 to 115MHz) with low noise amplifier support. This device requires very few external components if compared with other similar devices. It also supports RDS/RBDS functionalities, direct auto gain control (AGC) and real time adaptive noise cancellation function. The PU2CLR RDA5807 Arduino Library was developed to take the most functionalities of this device. Plese, check the [API Documentation](https://pu2clr.github.io/RDA5807/extras/apidoc/html/) for more details.

## Schematic

 In general, the RDA5807 can be found in kit or breakout form. In this case, the circuit below can help you to connect the arduino to the RDA5807 shield. If you are using just the IC, you might want to check the  [RDA5807M - SINGLE-CHIP BROADCAST FM RADIO TUNER - Rev.1.1–Aug.2015](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/RDA-Microelectronics-RDA5807MS_C167246.pdf); page 17.
